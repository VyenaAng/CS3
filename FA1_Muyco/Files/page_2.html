	<h1>Sleeping!</h1>
	<hr> 
		<ul>
			<li>Sleeping in general is something I'm very fond of, however, due to the to school I don't seem <br>
			to have the luxury to have full hourse of sleep, so I always take advantage of an oppurtunity.</li>
			<li>It is my way of de-stressing and my way of feeling freedom from any of my reponsibilities<br>
			even for just a short amount of time.</li>
			<li>I love how I can just lay down and rest when I have free time, it's kind of a habit now, it's somehow<br>
			how I reward myself after an exhausting day. The satisfaction of sleeping after being productive is just<br>
			something I can't seem to forget</li>
